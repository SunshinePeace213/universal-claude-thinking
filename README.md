## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Agent Usage
Agents automatically activate based on your requests:

```
# Research task - automatically delegates to R1 (Researcher)
"Find the latest developments in AI agent coordination"

# Analysis task - automatically delegates to A1 (Reasoner)  
"Analyze the trade-offs between different memory architectures"

# Content creation - automatically delegates to W1 (Writer)
"Write a technical brief on cognitive computing approaches"
```

### 2. Command Operations
Use commands for system operations:

```bash
# Monitor system health
/monitor-cognitive

# Generate usage report
/report-usage-stats

# Clean up and optimize
/maintain-cleanup

# Debug agent issues
/debug-agent-trace

# Set up new features
/setup-validate
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflows
Complex tasks automatically coordinate multiple agents:

```
"Research quantum computing trends, analyze implications for AI development, and write a strategic overview"

# Automatic workflow:
# 1. R1 researches quantum computing trends
# 2. A1 analyzes implications for AI  
# 3. W1 writes strategic overview
# 4. E1 validates final output
# 5. I1 presents results to user
```
