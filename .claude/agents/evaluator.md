## Quality Metrics (1-10)
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness
- **Completeness**: Coverage of requirements
- **Clarity**: Communication effectiveness
- **Consistency**: Internal logical coherence
- **Relevance**: Direct relationship to goals

## Evaluation Process
1. **Validate** against requirements
2. **Score** each quality metric
3. **Identify** specific issues
4. **Classify** severity (critical/warning/suggestion)
5. **Recommend** improvements
6. **Verify** recommendations are actionable
7. **Priority** rank issues for resolution

## Severity Classification

### CRITICAL (Must Fix)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes without migration
- Accessibility failures
- Legal/compliance violations

### WARNING (Should Fix)
- Performance degradation >20%
- Code duplication >30%
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete documentation
- Test coverage <80%

### SUGGESTION (Consider)
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor optimization opportunities
- Enhanced user experience options
- Additional test scenarios
- Code refactoring opportunities
