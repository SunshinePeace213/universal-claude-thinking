## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements the first layer (Atomic Foundation) of the 7-layer Context Engineering Architecture. It focuses on prompt quality analysis and enhancement, which will feed into subsequent layers for molecular context assembly and cellular memory integration.

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story implementation.

### Data Models
**AtomicAnalysis Model** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
```python
AtomicAnalysis(
    structure=structure,
    quality_score=score,
    gaps=gaps,
    enhancement_suggestions=self._generate_suggestions(gaps)
)
```

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/data-architecture-storage-systems.md#DatabaseSchemaDesign]
```sql
CREATE TABLE atomic_analyses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt_hash TEXT UNIQUE,
    structure JSONB NOT NULL,
    quality_score DECIMAL(3,1) CHECK (quality_score >= 1 AND quality_score <= 10),
    gaps JSONB,
    suggestions JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### API Specifications
**AtomicFoundation Class Core Method** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
```python
async def analyze_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> AtomicAnalysis:
    """Analyze prompt structure and return quality assessment."""
```

### Component Specifications
**Validation Components** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
- `AtomicValidator()` - atomic_validator.py
- `QualityScorer()` - scorer.py
- `GapAnalyzer()` - analyzer.py

**Chain of Verification Process** [Source: architecture/prompting-techniques-implementation.md#CoVeEnhancement]
```pseudocode
CoVe_Process:
    Step 1: baseline_response = analyze_prompt(user_input)
    Step 2: verification_questions = [
        "Is the task clearly defined?",
        "Are all constraints specified?", 
        "Is output format explicit?"
    ]
    Step 3: verification_answers = check_each_question(baseline_response)
    Step 4: IF any_answer_is_no THEN
               refined_response = enhance_prompt(baseline_response, missing_elements)
            RETURN refined_response

## Design Inspiration

The quality assessment approach in this story draws conceptual inspiration from quality frameworks like:
- **Multi-level scoring systems**: Similar to how advanced AI systems assess response quality
- **Structured validation**: Inspired by frameworks that prevent bias and ensure quality
- **Enhancement suggestions**: Based on patterns seen in cognitive quality improvement

Note: This story implements prompt analysis at the application level, distinct from any AI assistant's internal quality frameworks.

### Review Date: 2025-08-02
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates excellent quality with clean, modular architecture and strong adherence to coding standards. All acceptance criteria have been met with robust implementation patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/core/atomic/analyzer.py
  - **Change**: Refactored long `_extract_structure()` method into smaller, focused methods
  - **Why**: The method was 90+ lines and violated single responsibility principle
  - **How**: Split into `_extract_task()`, `_extract_constraints()`, and `_extract_output_format()` for better maintainability

- **File**: src/core/atomic/scorer.py
  - **Change**: Extracted magic numbers to named constants
  - **Why**: Hardcoded score adjustments made the code difficult to understand and maintain
  - **How**: Created `SCORE_ADJUSTMENTS` and `THRESHOLDS` dictionaries with descriptive names

- **File**: All Python files in src/core/atomic/
  - **Change**: Fixed whitespace in blank lines (43 occurrences)
  - **Why**: Maintain consistent code formatting standards
  - **How**: Used `uv run ruff format` to auto-fix formatting issues

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All functions have type annotations, pure cognitive functions, proper naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed per unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and cognitive tests with good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
[x] Refactored `_extract_structure()` method for better maintainability
[x] Extracted magic numbers in QualityScorer to named constants
[x] Fixed all formatting issues (whitespace in blank lines)
[ ] Consider moving safety patterns to configuration file (low priority)
[ ] Add parametrized tests to reduce test duplication (low priority)

### Security Review
- Input validation layer properly implemented with prompt injection detection
- Safety patterns comprehensive and effective
- Risk scoring provides good threat assessment
- No security vulnerabilities identified

### Performance Considerations
- Analysis consistently completes in <2ms (well under 500ms constraint)
- Efficient regex patterns with no backtracking issues
- Memory usage minimal with no leaks detected
- Performance scales well with prompt complexity

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation exceeds expectations with clean architecture, excellent test coverage, and robust safety features. Minor refactoring improvements were made to enhance maintainability without changing functionality. All tests continue to pass after refactoring.
