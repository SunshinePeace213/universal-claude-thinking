## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements the first layer (Atomic Foundation) of the 7-layer Context Engineering Architecture. It focuses on prompt quality analysis and enhancement, which will feed into subsequent layers for molecular context assembly and cellular memory integration.

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story implementation.

### Data Models
**AtomicAnalysis Model** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
```python
AtomicAnalysis(
    structure=structure,
    quality_score=score,
    gaps=gaps,
    enhancement_suggestions=self._generate_suggestions(gaps)
)
```

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/data-architecture-storage-systems.md#DatabaseSchemaDesign]
```sql
CREATE TABLE atomic_analyses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt_hash TEXT UNIQUE,
    structure JSONB NOT NULL,
    quality_score DECIMAL(3,1) CHECK (quality_score >= 1 AND quality_score <= 10),
    gaps JSONB,
    suggestions JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### API Specifications
**AtomicFoundation Class Core Method** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
```python
async def analyze_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> AtomicAnalysis:
    """Analyze prompt structure and return quality assessment."""
```

### Component Specifications
**Validation Components** [Source: architecture/7-layer-context-engineering-architecture.md#Layer1]
- `AtomicValidator()` - atomic_validator.py
- `QualityScorer()` - scorer.py
- `GapAnalyzer()` - analyzer.py
- `ChainOfVerification()` - CoVe enhancement

**Chain of Verification Process** [Source: architecture/prompting-techniques-implementation.md#CoVeEnhancement]
```pseudocode
CoVe_Process:
    Step 1: baseline_response = analyze_prompt(user_input)
    Step 2: verification_questions = [
        "Is the task clearly defined?",
        "Are all constraints specified?", 
        "Is output format explicit?"
    ]
    Step 3: verification_answers = check_each_question(baseline_response)
    Step 4: IF any_answer_is_no THEN
               refined_response = enhance_prompt(baseline_response, missing_elements)
            RETURN refined_response

## Design Inspiration

The quality assessment approach in this story draws conceptual inspiration from quality frameworks like:
- **Multi-level scoring systems**: Similar to how advanced AI systems assess response quality
- **Structured validation**: Inspired by frameworks that prevent bias and ensure quality
- **Enhancement suggestions**: Based on patterns seen in cognitive quality improvement

Note: This story implements prompt analysis at the application level, distinct from any AI assistant's internal quality frameworks.
