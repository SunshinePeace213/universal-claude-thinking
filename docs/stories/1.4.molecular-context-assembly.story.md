# Story 1.4: Molecular Context Assembly with Embedding Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system processing user requests,
**I want** intelligent example selection using Qwen3 embeddings and vector storage,
**so that** each request receives semantically matched context for optimal responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic example selection uses Qwen3-Embedding-8B for semantic similarity (cosine >0.85)
2. Context assembly follows MOLECULE structure with embedding-based retrieval
3. Generate 4096-dim embeddings for all examples and store in sqlite-vec
4. Token allocation optimized for 1024-token chunks with 15% overlap
5. Example effectiveness tracked with scores affecting future retrieval rankings
6. Context construction completes in <800ms including embedding generation
7. Batch process up to 32 examples simultaneously on Mac M3 MPS
8. Maintain vector index with <100ms similarity search latency
9. Implement dual model support: Qwen3-Embedding-8B (primary) and Qwen3-Embedding-8B-4bit-DWQ (Mac optimized)
10. Create benchmarking framework comparing both models on accuracy, latency, memory usage, and throughput
11. Adaptive model selection based on benchmark results and runtime requirements

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the Molecular layer (Layer 2) of the Context Engineering architecture, focusing on intelligent context assembly through semantic similarity matching.

### MOLECULE Concept Foundation
Based on the Context Engineering principles ([Source: GitHub davidkimai/Context-Engineering/00_foundations/02_molecules_context.md]):
- **MOLECULE Structure**: [INSTRUCTION] + [EXAMPLES] + [CONTEXT] + [NEW INPUT]
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Provides 10-30% accuracy improvement through pattern recognition
- **Dynamic Example Selection**: Retrieves most relevant examples based on semantic similarity
- **Measurable Benefits**: Higher accuracy, greater consistency, better format adherence

### Database Schema
The system will utilize the existing database schema defined in the architecture:
- **memory_vectors table**: Virtual table using sqlite-vec for 4096-dimensional embeddings [Source: architecture/data-architecture-storage-systems.md#L52-56]
  - sqlite-vec supports up to 16000 dimensions, well above our 4096 requirement
  - Uses `serialize_float32()` for efficient BLOB conversion
  - Built-in cosine similarity distance metrics available
- **molecular_contexts table**: Stores context assembly metadata and effectiveness scores [Source: architecture/data-architecture-storage-systems.md#L18-28]
- **memories table**: Integration point for embedding storage with BLOB field [Source: architecture/data-architecture-storage-systems.md#L31-50]

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure, implement components in:
- **Core Molecular Layer**: `src/core/molecular/` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L42-45]
  - `example_selector.py` - Dynamic example selection logic
  - `context_builder.py` - Context assembly with MOLECULE structure
  - `vector_store.py` - Semantic similarity operations
- **RAG Pipeline**: `src/rag/` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L107-115]
  - `embedder.py` - Qwen3-Embedding-8B integration
  - `pipeline.py` - Main RAG orchestrator
  - `custom_scorer.py` - Hybrid scoring algorithm
- **Memory Integration**: `src/memory/embeddings.py` - Qwen3 embedding integration [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L92]

### Technical Requirements
- **Models**: 
  - **Primary**: Qwen3-Embedding-8B for generating 4096-dimensional embeddings (most powerful)
  - **Secondary**: Qwen3-Embedding-8B-4bit-DWQ optimized for Mac Series (same dimensions, better resource efficiency)
  - **Note**: Both models are pre-prepared from Story 1.3 implementation
- **Storage**: sqlite-vec for zero external dependencies (configured for 4096 dimensions)
- **Performance**: 
  - Total context construction: <800ms
  - Similarity search latency: <100ms
  - Batch processing: Up to 32 examples on Mac M3 MPS
- **Similarity Threshold**: Cosine similarity >0.85 for example selection
- **Token Management**: 1024-token chunks with 15% overlap

### Integration Points
- **Memory Consolidation System**: Integrate with promotion pipeline for effectiveness tracking [Source: architecture/memory-consolidation-system.md#L31-48]
- **5-Layer Memory Architecture**: Examples flow through STM→WM→LTM based on effectiveness scores
- **Privacy Engine**: Ensure PII detection before storing embeddings

### Coding Standards
Follow project coding standards:
- **Async-First Design**: All I/O operations must be async with timeout handling [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L11]
- **Type Annotations**: Complete type annotations for all functions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L12]
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `generate_embedding()`)
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `EmbeddingGenerator`)
  - Config: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`)

### Testing Requirements

- Performance benchmarks required for all acceptance criteria timing requirements
- Mock Qwen3 model for unit tests to avoid dependency on model availability
