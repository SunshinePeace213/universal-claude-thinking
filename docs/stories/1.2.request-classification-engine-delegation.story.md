# Story 1.2: Request Classification Engine with Delegation Integration

## Status
✅ Done

## Story
**As a** user submitting requests to the system,
**I want** automatic detection of task complexity and type with intelligent routing,
**so that** the system can delegate my request to appropriate specialists through the 3-stage system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Classification engine detects A/B/C/D/E task types with >95% accuracy
2. Classification results feed into 3-stage delegation engine (keyword → semantic → PE fallback)
3. Type A (Simple/Direct) routes through fast keyword matching (<10ms)
4. Type B (Complex/Multi-step) uses semantic delegation with agent embeddings
5. Type C (Research) triggers R1 agent with confidence score >0.9
6. Type D (Web/Testing) routes to T1 with tool capability mapping
7. Type E (Debugging) activates A1 with reasoning chain requirements
8. Ambiguous classifications (confidence <0.7) route to PE for enhancement
9. Classification and delegation metrics are logged for optimization

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements request classification and delegation integration, building on the Atomic Foundation from Story 1.1. It introduces the 3-stage hybrid delegation system that intelligently routes user requests to appropriate specialist sub-agents.

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- AtomicFoundation class successfully analyzes prompt structure with <500ms performance
- Quality scoring (1-10 scale) provides reliable prompt assessment
- Chain of Verification (CoVe) enhancement reduces hallucinations by 30-50%
- Claude Code hooks (atomic_validator.py, prompt_enhancer.py) are registered and functional
- Qwen3-Embedding-8B model is configured for embeddings (1536-dim vectors)

- Tests: `/tests/unit/test_classification.py`, `/tests/unit/test_delegation.py` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#TestSuite]
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/test_classification_delegation_flow.py`

### Testing Requirements
**Performance Constraints** [Story AC #3, #9]
- Keyword matching: <10ms latency requirement
- Semantic matching: 50-100ms acceptable range
- Classification accuracy: >95% target
- Confidence threshold: 0.7 for direct routing, <0.7 triggers PE fallback

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#CriticalCognitiveArchitectureRules]
- All cognitive functions must be pure functions with no side effects
- Type annotations required for all functions including returns
- Async-first design for I/O operations with timeout handling
- Test naming: `test_` prefix with descriptive names

### Technical Constraints
- Classification confidence thresholds: [Source: architecture/agent-automatic-delegation-tool-seo-optimization.md#three-stage-delegation-system]
  - Keyword matching: 0.9 confidence
  - Semantic matching: 0.7 minimum
  - PE fallback: Always 1.0 confidence
- Performance targets:
  - Stage 1 (Keyword): <10ms
  - Stage 2 (Semantic): 50-100ms
  - Stage 3 (PE): 100-200ms
- Embedding model: Qwen3-Embedding-8B (1536 dimensions)
- Vector similarity: Cosine similarity with 0.85 threshold

### Reference: Request Classification from CLAUDE-v3.md

**Classification Types (Priority Order: E→D→C→B→A):**
- **Type E** - Debugging/Error Resolution (reactive problem-solving)
- **Type D** - Web/Testing (specialized testing workflows)
- **Type C** - Research Required (information gathering)
- **Type B** - Complex/Multi-step (proactive development)
- **Type A** - Simple/Direct (basic information)

**Note:** This classification system ensures proper routing priority and delegation logic.

### Confidence Threshold Matrix

| Task Type | Min Confidence | Delegation Method | Fallback |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| TYPE_A | 0.95 | Keyword Match | Semantic |
| TYPE_B | 0.85 | Keyword/Semantic | PE Enhancement |
| TYPE_C | 0.90 | Semantic Match | PE Enhancement |
| TYPE_D | 0.85 | Semantic Match | PE Enhancement |
| TYPE_E | 0.80 | Keyword/Semantic | PE Enhancement |

**Note:** Confidence below threshold triggers next delegation stage or PE fallback.
