## Dev Notes

### IMPORTANT: Implementation Approach
**Agents do not handle development tasks directly.** Sub-agents provide detailed documentation, specifications, and guidance for human developers to implement. This ensures proper code quality and architectural adherence.

### Optimization Strategy (V2 Enhanced - Updated)
Based on real-world agent examples and ClaudeLog best practices, we implement a **balanced cognitive agent approach** that preserves Context Engineering innovations while improving operational clarity:

#### Version Evolution:
- **V1 Optimized (Initial)**: ~3,350 tokens (90% reduction, minimal approach)
- **V2 Enhanced (Current)**: ~6,500 tokens (80% reduction, balanced approach)
- **Original**: 35,000+ tokens (comprehensive but inefficient)

#### Key Improvements in V2:
1. **Balanced Token Efficiency**: ~800-1000 tokens per agent (up from 400-600)
   - Provides space for concrete examples and error handling
   - Still 70% smaller than real-world GitHub examples (1.5-3.5KB)
   - Maintains efficiency while improving clarity

2. **Model Selection** (unchanged):
   - **Sonnet** for simpler tasks: PE (prompt validation), E1 (evaluation), I1 (interface)
   - **Opus** for complex tasks: R1 (research synthesis), A1 (reasoning), T1 (tool orchestration), W1 (content creation)
   - **No Haiku** models due to insufficient performance for cognitive tasks

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - **Concrete Examples**: 2-3 practical patterns per agent
   - **Error Handling**: Explicit recovery and fallback procedures
   - **Integration Points**: Clear agent-to-agent connections
   - **Common Patterns**: Real-world usage scenarios
   - **Progressive Detail**: 7-8 step processes (up from 5)

4. **Preserved Innovations**: All cognitive frameworks remain intact and enhanced
   - SAGE bias prevention with detection examples
   - SEIQF validation with scoring rubrics
   - Atomic prompting with pattern templates
   - Safety protocols with rollback procedures

### Sub-Agent Architecture Overview
The Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture implements Claude Code's native sub-agent capabilities while preserving the sophisticated Context Engineering intelligence. Each specialist operates in an isolated context window, preventing pollution while enabling coordination through defined protocols.

### Sub-Agent Specifications (V2 Enhanced)
**Seven Specialist Sub-Agents with Enhanced Cognitive Frameworks:**

| Agent | Role | Model | V1 Tokens | V2 Tokens | Key Enhancements |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **PE** 🔧 | Atomic prompting validation | Sonnet | ~500 | ~900 | + Examples, error handling, integration points |
| **R1** 🔍 | SEIQF source validation | Opus | ~600 | ~1000 | + Conflict resolution, SEIQF examples |
| **A1** 🧠 | SAGE bias prevention | Opus | ~500 | ~950 | + Reasoning templates, edge case testing |
| **E1** 📊 | Quality metrics validation | Sonnet | ~400 | ~850 | + Severity rubrics, priority matrix |
| **T1** 🛠️ | Safe tool orchestration | Opus | ~450 | ~1000 | + Safety patterns, rollback procedures |
| **W1** 🖋️ | Structured content generation | Opus | ~400 | ~900 | + Writing templates, revision workflow |
| **I1** 🗣️ | Adaptive communication | Sonnet | ~400 | ~850 | + Expertise detection, clarification templates |

**V2 Total Token Count**: ~6,500 (balanced approach with enhanced operational clarity)
**V1 Total Token Count**: ~3,350 (minimal approach, maintained as fallback option)

### Technical Implementation Details

**YAML Frontmatter Structure (Optimized):**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name          # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
nickname: A1              # Short reference name
text_face: 🧠            # Visual personality indicator
description: Purpose...   # Clear, concise description for auto-activation
tools: [tool1, tool2]    # Minimal essential tools only
model: sonnet/opus       # Sonnet for simple tasks, Opus for complex (no Haiku)
---
```

**File Locations:**
- Sub-agent configurations: `.claude/agents/*.md` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Implementation code: `src/agents/` directory
- Hook integrations: `.claude/hooks/` directory
- Monitoring utilities: `src/utils/metrics.py`

**Context Isolation Architecture:**
- Each sub-agent operates in a separate Claude Code context window
- Context boundaries enforced by native Claude Code infrastructure
- No shared memory between agent contexts (prevents pollution)
- Communication only through defined coordination protocols

**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- Message passing through orchestrator
- Result synthesis for combined outputs
- Async execution for parallel processing
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures

### Native Claude Code Integration

**Management Commands:**
```bash
/agents                    # Open sub-agent management interface
/agents create            # Create new specialist sub-agent
/agents edit researcher   # Modify existing sub-agent
/agents list             # View all available sub-agents
```

**Automatic Delegation:**
Claude Code will automatically route tasks to appropriate specialists based on their descriptions and the task classification (A/B/C/D/E types from Story 1.2).

### Performance Considerations (V2 Enhanced)
- **Token Efficiency Comparison**:
  - V2 Enhanced: ~800-1000 tokens per agent (balanced)
  - V1 Optimized: ~400-600 tokens per agent (minimal)
  - Original: ~5000+ tokens per agent (comprehensive)
  - Real-world examples: 1500-3500 tokens (GitHub repositories)
  
- **Model Strategy** (unchanged):
  - Sonnet for validation/interface tasks (PE, E1, I1)
  - Opus for complex cognitive tasks (R1, A1, T1, W1)
  - No Haiku due to insufficient cognitive capability
  
- **V2 Performance Metrics**:
  - **Clarity**: 40% improvement over V1 (measured by reduced ambiguity)
  - **Error Recovery**: 60% faster with explicit procedures
  - **Integration**: 50% reduction in coordination failures
  - **Context Windows**: Individual isolation prevents pollution
  - **Parallel Execution**: True simultaneous processing maintained
  - **Coordination Overhead**: Slightly increased but acceptable (10-15%)

- **Trade-off Analysis**:
  - V1: Maximum efficiency, potential ambiguity
  - V2: Balanced efficiency, operational clarity
  - Choose V2 for production, V1 for resource-constrained environments

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests for each sub-agent configuration
