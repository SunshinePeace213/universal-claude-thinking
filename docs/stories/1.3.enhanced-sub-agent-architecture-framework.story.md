# Story 1.3: Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** native sub-agent infrastructure with simplified management,
**so that** I can coordinate multiple specialists without complex orchestration code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Native `/agents` command provides sub-agent management interface
2. Individual context windows are created for each specialist sub-agent
3. Sub-agent isolation prevents context pollution between specialists
4. Basic coordination protocols enable communication between sub-agents
5. Error handling ensures isolated failures don't cascade across specialists
6. Performance monitoring tracks sub-agent utilization and coordination efficiency
7. Sub-agent configurations are stored in version-controlled `.claude/agents/` files

## Dev Notes

### IMPORTANT: Implementation Approach
**Agents do not handle development tasks directly.** Sub-agents provide detailed documentation, specifications, and guidance for human developers to implement. This ensures proper code quality and architectural adherence.

### Optimization Strategy (Updated)
Based on agent engineering best practices, we use **optimized cognitive agents** rather than micro-agents to preserve Context Engineering innovations while improving efficiency:

1. **Token Efficiency**: Reduced from 35,000+ to ~3,350 total tokens (90% reduction)
2. **Model Selection**:
   - **Sonnet** for simpler tasks: PE (prompt validation), E1 (evaluation), I1 (interface)
   - **Opus** for complex tasks: R1 (research synthesis), A1 (reasoning), T1 (tool orchestration), W1 (content creation)
   - **No Haiku** models due to insufficient performance for cognitive tasks
3. **Preserved Innovations**: All cognitive frameworks (SAGE, SEIQF, atomic prompting) remain intact
4. **Focused Tools**: Each agent has only essential tools, reducing activation complexity

### Sub-Agent Architecture Overview
The Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture implements Claude Code's native sub-agent capabilities while preserving the sophisticated Context Engineering intelligence. Each specialist operates in an isolated context window, preventing pollution while enabling coordination through defined protocols.

### Sub-Agent Specifications (Optimized)
**Seven Specialist Sub-Agents with Cognitive Frameworks:**
1. **PE (Prompt Enhancer)** üîß - Atomic prompting validation (Sonnet, ~500 tokens)
2. **R1 (Researcher)** üîç - SEIQF source validation framework (Opus, ~600 tokens)
3. **A1 (Reasoner)** üß† - SAGE bias prevention system (Opus, ~500 tokens)
4. **E1 (Evaluator)** üìä - Quality metrics validation (Sonnet, ~400 tokens)
5. **T1 (Tool User)** üõ†Ô∏è - Safe tool orchestration (Opus, ~450 tokens)
6. **W1 (Writer)** üñãÔ∏è - Structured content generation (Opus, ~400 tokens)
7. **I1 (Interface)** üó£Ô∏è - Adaptive communication (Sonnet, ~400 tokens)

**Total Token Count**: ~3,350 (90% reduction from original while preserving all cognitive innovations)

### Technical Implementation Details

**YAML Frontmatter Structure (Optimized):**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name          # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
nickname: A1              # Short reference name
text_face: üß†            # Visual personality indicator
description: Purpose...   # Clear, concise description for auto-activation
tools: [tool1, tool2]    # Minimal essential tools only
model: sonnet/opus       # Sonnet for simple tasks, Opus for complex (no Haiku)
---
```

**File Locations:**
- Sub-agent configurations: `.claude/agents/*.md` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Implementation code: `src/agents/` directory
- Hook integrations: `.claude/hooks/` directory
- Monitoring utilities: `src/utils/metrics.py`

**Context Isolation Architecture:**
- Each sub-agent operates in a separate Claude Code context window
- Context boundaries enforced by native Claude Code infrastructure
- No shared memory between agent contexts (prevents pollution)
- Communication only through defined coordination protocols

**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- Message passing through orchestrator
- Result synthesis for combined outputs
- Async execution for parallel processing
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures

### Native Claude Code Integration

**Management Commands:**
```bash
/agents                    # Open sub-agent management interface
/agents create            # Create new specialist sub-agent
/agents edit researcher   # Modify existing sub-agent
/agents list             # View all available sub-agents
```

**Automatic Delegation:**
Claude Code will automatically route tasks to appropriate specialists based on their descriptions and the task classification (A/B/C/D/E types from Story 1.2).

### Performance Considerations (Optimized)
- **Token Efficiency**: Each agent ~400-600 tokens (was 5000+)
- **Model Strategy**: 
  - Sonnet for validation/interface tasks (PE, E1, I1)
  - Opus for complex cognitive tasks (R1, A1, T1, W1)
  - No Haiku due to insufficient cognitive capability
- **Context Windows**: Individual isolation prevents pollution
- **Parallel Execution**: True simultaneous processing with isolated contexts
- **Coordination Overhead**: Minimal with streamlined protocols

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests for each sub-agent configuration
- Integration tests for coordination protocols
- Performance benchmarks for parallel execution
- Error isolation validation
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Testing
- [ ] Validate all 7 sub-agent configurations load correctly
- [ ] Test context isolation between agents
- [ ] Verify coordination protocols work as expected
- [ ] Confirm error isolation prevents cascades
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements from parallelization
- [ ] Test integration with delegation engine
