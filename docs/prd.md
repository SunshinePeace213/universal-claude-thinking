### Background Context

Universal Claude Thinking v2 addresses a critical architectural crisis in advanced AI prompt engineering. The current CLAUDE-v3.md system, while comprehensive at 38k+ tokens, suffers from maintenance overhead, performance bottlenecks, and expansion limitations that prevent rapid innovation and community adoption. Traditional prompt engineering treats prompts as static text rather than dynamic, programmable systems.

This PRD defines the transformation into a revolutionary **Programmable Cognitive Intelligence Platform** that combines sophisticated Context Engineering architecture with Anthropic's native sub-agent infrastructure. The solution preserves all existing cognitive capabilities while enabling unprecedented modularity, parallel processing, and community-driven evolution. This represents the ultimate evolution from procedural prompt engineering to declarative cognitive architectures with function-based reasoning, meta-programming capabilities, and persistent community learning.

The architecture now includes groundbreaking innovations beyond the original design:
- **5-Layer Memory System** with privacy-first local operations and intelligent promotion pipeline
- **Hybrid RAG Pipeline** combining bi-encoder speed with cross-encoder accuracy for optimal retrieval
- **3-Stage Delegation Engine** for intelligent, confidence-based task routing
- **Comprehensive Command Architecture** with 5 operational categories for system management
- **3-Tier Installation Methods** supporting diverse deployment scenarios from quick start to enterprise

### Story 8.5: Delegation Performance Monitoring
As a **system focused on continuous improvement**,  
I want **comprehensive tracking of delegation decisions**,  
so that **routing accuracy improves over time**.

**Detailed Description**: Every delegation decision provides learning opportunities. This monitoring system tracks routing decisions, confidence scores, user satisfaction, and task outcomes to identify patterns and optimization opportunities, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Log all delegation decisions with confidence scores
2. Track delegation accuracy through task completion
3. Monitor latency for each delegation stage
4. Identify common routing failures and patterns
5. Generate delegation analytics and reports
6. Support A/B testing of routing strategies
7. Provide real-time delegation dashboard

### Story 8.6: Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
As a **system handling complex multi-faceted tasks**,  
I want **coordinated delegation to multiple specialists**,  
so that **complex requests are handled comprehensively**.

**Detailed Description**: Some requests require multiple agents working together (e.g., "research and analyze this topic, then write a report"). This story implements coordination patterns including sequential handoffs, parallel execution, and result synthesis for complex multi-agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Detect multi-agent requirements from request analysis
2. Support sequential agent chaining with context passing
3. Enable parallel agent execution for independent subtasks
4. Implement Map-Reduce pattern for research aggregation
5. Coordinate result synthesis across multiple agents
6. Maintain execution context throughout workflow
7. Provide progress tracking for long-running workflows

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
**Initiate UX Architecture Mode**: "Based on the Universal Claude Thinking v2 PRD, create a comprehensive UX architecture that translates the 7-layer cognitive architecture and Enhanced Sub-Agent coordination into intuitive user interfaces. Focus on visualizing cognitive processes, specialist coordination, and memory systems in ways that provide transparency without overwhelming users. Design interaction patterns that leverage the parallel processing capabilities while maintaining simplicity for both technical and non-technical users."

### Architect Prompt
**Initiate Technical Architecture Mode**: "Using the Universal Claude Thinking v2 PRD as foundation, design the complete technical architecture for the Programmable Cognitive Intelligence Platform. Implement the 7-layer Context Engineering system (Atomic→Molecular→Cellular→Organ→Cognitive Tools→Prompt Programming→Sub-Agent Management) with Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture, ensuring native `/agents` integration, true parallel processing through individual context windows, and SWARM-based memory systems. Provide detailed implementation specifications for all 16+ cognitive capabilities while maintaining the 80% complexity reduction goal."
