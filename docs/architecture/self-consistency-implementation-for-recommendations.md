# Self-Consistency Implementation for Recommendations

## Purpose

Implement Self-Consistency prompting technique specifically for scenarios where users request suggestions, ideas, or recommendations. This technique generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answers, improving accuracy by 10-20%.

## Implementation Architecture

```python
class SelfConsistencyRecommender:
    """
    Implements Self-Consistency for recommendation scenarios.
    Generates multiple reasoning paths in parallel and votes for consistency.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, orchestrator: OrganOrchestrator, voting_engine: VotingEngine):
        self.orchestrator = orchestrator
        self.voting_engine = voting_engine
        self.parallel_paths = 5  # Number of reasoning paths
        
    async def generate_recommendations(self, user_query: str) -> RecommendationResult:
        """Generate recommendations using self-consistency approach."""
        # Detect recommendation request
        if not self._is_recommendation_request(user_query):
            return None
            
        # Generate multiple reasoning paths in parallel
        reasoning_tasks = []
        for i in range(self.parallel_paths):
            # Each path uses different random seed for diversity
            task = self._create_reasoning_task(user_query, seed=i)
            reasoning_tasks.append(task)
        
        # Execute all paths in parallel (leveraging Layer 4)
        reasoning_results = await self.orchestrator.execute_parallel_tasks(reasoning_tasks)
        
        # Extract recommendations from each path
        all_recommendations = []
        for result in reasoning_results:
            recommendations = self._extract_recommendations(result)
            all_recommendations.extend(recommendations)
        
        # Vote for most consistent recommendations
        voting_result = await self.voting_engine.vote_recommendations(
            all_recommendations,
            similarity_threshold=0.85
        )
        
        # Select top recommendations by vote count
        top_recommendations = voting_result.get_top_n(3)
        
        return RecommendationResult(
            recommendations=top_recommendations,
            confidence_score=voting_result.consistency_score,
            reasoning_paths_used=len(reasoning_results),
            consensus_strength=voting_result.consensus_strength
        )
    
    def _is_recommendation_request(self, query: str) -> bool:
        """Detect if user is asking for recommendations."""
        recommendation_keywords = [
            "suggest", "recommend", "ideas", "options", "alternatives",
            "what should", "what could", "best ways", "how to improve"
        ]
        return any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in recommendation_keywords)
```

## Voting Mechanism

```pseudocode
Voting_Process:
    recommendations_by_similarity = group_by_semantic_similarity(all_recommendations)
    
    FOR each group in recommendations_by_similarity:
        vote_count = len(group.recommendations)
        average_confidence = mean(group.confidence_scores)
        consistency_score = calculate_consistency(group.variations)
        
        group.final_score = (
            vote_count * 0.4 +
            average_confidence * 0.3 +
            consistency_score * 0.3
        )
    
    RETURN groups sorted by final_score descending
```

## Use Case Examples

| User Query | Reasoning Paths | Expected Output |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| "What are some ways to optimize my code?" | 5 parallel paths | Top 3 consistent optimization strategies |
| "Suggest improvements for my architecture" | 5 parallel paths | Top 3 architectural improvements |
| "What tools should I use for testing?" | 5 parallel paths | Top 3 testing tool recommendations |

## Integration with Existing Architecture

1. **Leverages Layer 4**: Uses existing parallel processing infrastructure
2. **Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents can contribute to each reasoning path
3. **Memory Integration**: Can retrieve past successful recommendations
4. **Quality Validation**: E1 agent validates each recommendation

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy Improvement**: 10-20% over single-path recommendations
- **Processing Time**: ~2-3x single path (mitigated by parallelization)
- **Consistency Score**: Typically 0.7-0.9 for good recommendations
- **User Satisfaction**: Expected 15-25% improvement in recommendation quality
