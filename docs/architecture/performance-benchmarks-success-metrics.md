    Comprehensive quality measurement system.
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_cognitive_effectiveness(
        result: CognitiveResult,
        baseline: BaselineResult
    ) -> EffectivenessScore:

            "reasoning_accuracy": (
                result.accuracy / baseline.accuracy - 1
            ) * 100,
            "completeness": (
