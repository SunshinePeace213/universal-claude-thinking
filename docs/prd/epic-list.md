# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Cognitive Infrastructure** - Establish the 7-layer Context Engineering foundation with Atomic-Molecular-Cellular layers, implement basic request classification, and create the Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture framework with native `/agents` command integration and foundational memory systems.

**Epic 2: Multi-Agent Specialist Coordination** - Implement the 7 specialized sub-agents (Prompt-Enhancer, Researcher, Reasoner, Evaluator, Tool-User, Writer, Interface) with individual context windows, parallel processing capabilities, coordinated workflow management, and integration hooks for delegation system.

**Epic 3: Advanced Cognitive Tools & Memory Systems** - Develop the Cognitive Tools Integration layer with prompt programs, context schemas, and recursive prompting, while preparing for advanced memory integration with the upcoming 5-layer system.

**Epic 4: Prompt Programming & Meta-Cognitive Architecture** - Create the Prompt Programming layer with cognitive functions, function composition, meta-programming capabilities, and community function libraries with quality assurance frameworks.

**Epic 5: Community Platform & Production Optimization** - Implement community sharing mechanisms, production-grade monitoring and optimization, comprehensive testing frameworks, and open source ecosystem tools for widespread adoption.

**Epic 6: 5-Layer Memory System Implementation** - Build the complete hierarchical memory system with STM→WM→LTM→SWARM→Privacy layers, including automatic promotion pipelines, vector-based retrieval, and privacy-preserving community learning.

**Epic 7: Hybrid RAG Pipeline Development** - Implement the two-stage retrieval system combining Qwen3-Embedding-8B for fast candidate retrieval and Qwen3-Reranker-8B for precise reranking, with custom scoring and Mac M3 optimization.

**Epic 8: Delegation & Command Architecture** - Create the intelligent 3-stage delegation system for automatic task routing and implement the 5-category command structure for operational management.
