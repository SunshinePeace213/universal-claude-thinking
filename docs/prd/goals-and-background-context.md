## Background Context

Universal Claude Thinking v2 addresses a critical architectural crisis in advanced AI prompt engineering. The current CLAUDE-v3.md system, while comprehensive at 38k+ tokens, suffers from maintenance overhead, performance bottlenecks, and expansion limitations that prevent rapid innovation and community adoption. Traditional prompt engineering treats prompts as static text rather than dynamic, programmable systems.

This PRD defines the transformation into a revolutionary **Programmable Cognitive Intelligence Platform** that combines sophisticated Context Engineering architecture with Anthropic's native sub-agent infrastructure. The solution preserves all existing cognitive capabilities while enabling unprecedented modularity, parallel processing, and community-driven evolution. This represents the ultimate evolution from procedural prompt engineering to declarative cognitive architectures with function-based reasoning, meta-programming capabilities, and persistent community learning.

The architecture now includes groundbreaking innovations beyond the original design:
- **5-Layer Memory System** with privacy-first local operations and intelligent promotion pipeline
- **Hybrid RAG Pipeline** combining bi-encoder speed with cross-encoder accuracy for optimal retrieval
- **3-Stage Delegation Engine** for intelligent, confidence-based task routing
- **Comprehensive Command Architecture** with 5 operational categories for system management
- **3-Tier Installation Methods** supporting diverse deployment scenarios from quick start to enterprise
