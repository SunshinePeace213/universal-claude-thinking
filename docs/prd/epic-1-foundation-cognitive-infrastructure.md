# Epic 1: Foundation & Cognitive Infrastructure

**Epic Goal**: Establish the foundational Context Engineering architecture with the first three layers (Atomic, Molecular, Cellular) while implementing the Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture framework. This epic delivers a working cognitive system with basic request classification, native sub-agent management, and foundational memory capabilities that provides immediate value through improved prompt quality and basic specialist coordination.

## Story 1.1: Atomic Foundation Implementation
As a **developer using Claude Code**,  
I want **automatic prompt quality analysis and enhancement suggestions**,  
so that **I can improve my prompts before they are processed by the system**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System analyzes prompts using atomic prompting principles (Task + Constraints + Output Format)
2. Quality scoring system rates prompts 1-10 with specific improvement recommendations
3. Analysis completes in <500ms with detailed rationale for scores below 7/10
4. Gap analysis identifies missing components with "Do you mean XXX?" clarification options
5. Enhanced prompts follow atomic structure with measurable quality improvements
6. System provides 3-5 enhancement paths based on atomic prompting guidelines

## Story 1.2: Request Classification Engine with Delegation Integration
As a **user submitting requests to the system**,  
I want **automatic detection of task complexity and type with intelligent routing**,  
so that **the system can delegate my request to appropriate specialists through the 3-stage system**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Classification engine detects A/B/C/D/E task types with >95% accuracy
2. Classification results feed into 3-stage delegation engine (keyword → semantic → PE fallback)
3. Type A (Simple/Direct) routes through fast keyword matching (<10ms)
4. Type B (Complex/Multi-step) uses semantic delegation with agent embeddings
5. Type C (Research) triggers R1 agent with confidence score >0.9
6. Type D (Web/Testing) routes to T1 with tool capability mapping
7. Type E (Debugging) activates A1 with reasoning chain requirements
8. Ambiguous classifications (confidence <0.7) route to PE for enhancement
9. Classification and delegation metrics are logged for optimization

## Story 1.3: Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture Framework
As a **system administrator**,  
I want **native sub-agent infrastructure with simplified management**,  
so that **I can coordinate multiple specialists without complex orchestration code**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Native `/agents` command provides sub-agent management interface
2. Individual context windows are created for each specialist sub-agent
3. Sub-agent isolation prevents context pollution between specialists
4. Basic coordination protocols enable communication between sub-agents
5. Error handling ensures isolated failures don't cascade across specialists
6. Performance monitoring tracks sub-agent utilization and coordination efficiency
7. Sub-agent configurations are stored in version-controlled `.claude/agents/` files

## Story 1.4: Molecular Context Assembly with Embedding Integration
As a **system processing user requests**,  
I want **intelligent example selection using Qwen3 embeddings and vector storage**,  
so that **each request receives semantically matched context for optimal responses**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic example selection uses Qwen3-Embedding-8B for semantic similarity (cosine >0.85)
2. Context assembly follows MOLECULE structure with embedding-based retrieval
3. Generate 1536-dim embeddings for all examples and store in sqlite-vec
4. Token allocation optimized for 1024-token chunks with 15% overlap
5. Example effectiveness tracked with scores affecting future retrieval rankings
6. Context construction completes in <800ms including embedding generation
7. Batch process up to 32 examples simultaneously on Mac M3 MPS
8. Maintain vector index with <100ms similarity search latency

## Story 1.5: Memory System Foundation with 5-Layer Architecture
As a **user working across sessions**,  
I want **hierarchical memory continuity through the 5-layer system**,  
so that **the system learns from interactions while preserving my privacy**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement STM (2h TTL) with in-memory cache and SQLite backup
2. Configure WM (7d TTL) with promotion threshold >5.0 effectiveness
3. Prepare LTM foundation for patterns with >8.0 score and >5 uses
4. Integrate Privacy Engine for PII detection and stripping
5. Memory retrieval using Qwen3-Embedding-8B with <100ms latency
6. Store embeddings in sqlite-vec for zero external dependencies
7. Implement promotion pipeline: STM→WM→LTM with configurable thresholds
8. Support SWARM opt-in preparation (implementation in Epic 6)
9. Memory effectiveness scoring with +0.3/-0.3 feedback adjustments

## Story 1.6: Dynamic Header System
As a **user interacting with the system**,  
I want **comprehensive status information displayed consistently**,  
so that **I understand the system's cognitive state and processing approach**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Headers display current cognitive architecture layer activation
2. Request classification results are shown with confidence scores
3. Active sub-agents and their status are indicated in real-time
4. Memory utilization and context window usage are tracked
5. Processing mode (Auto Plan, Direct, Research) is clearly indicated
6. Headers maintain consistency while adapting to cognitive tool outputs
