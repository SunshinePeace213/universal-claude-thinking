# Epic 4: Prompt Programming & Meta-Cognitive Architecture

**Epic Goal**: Implement the revolutionary Prompt Programming layer that transforms cognitive reasoning into programmable functions with composition, meta-programming, and dynamic architecture generation capabilities. This epic completes the Context Engineering evolution pathway, enabling users to create, compose, and share cognitive functions while the system develops self-programming capabilities and community-driven cognitive evolution.

## Story 4.1: Cognitive Function Framework with CoVe/ReAct
As a **developer wanting programmable reasoning**,  
I want **cognitive patterns as callable functions with advanced prompting**,  
so that **I can compose complex reasoning workflows with minimal hallucination**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cognitive functions implement CoVe for 30-50% hallucination reduction
2. ReAct pattern integrated for thought-action-observation cycles
3. Function library includes 50+ pre-built patterns (analysis, synthesis, evaluation)
4. Self-consistency validation across 3-5 reasoning paths per function
5. Protocol shells provide Qwen3 model integration templates
6. Function execution achieves <3s with 95%+ accuracy
7. Version control for prompt templates with A/B testing
8. Performance metrics tracked: accuracy, hallucination rate, latency
9. Integration with 5-layer memory for context-aware reasoning

## Story 4.2: Function Composition with Map-Reduce Patterns
As a **user building complex cognitive workflows**,  
I want **advanced composition patterns for parallel processing**,  
so that **I can leverage multiple specialists simultaneously**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Map-Reduce pattern for research aggregation across agents
2. Pipeline composition with automatic delegation routing
3. Parallel execution leverages all available specialists
4. Context passing maintains state across function chains
5. Error handling with fallback to Prompt Enhancer agent
6. Composition validation ensures type safety and compatibility
7. Performance optimization through batch processing
8. Visual workflow builder for non-technical users
9. Export/import workflows as shareable JSON templates

## Story 4.3: Meta-Programming with Recursive Improvement
As a **system capable of self-improvement**,  
I want **recursive prompting for automatic quality enhancement**,  
so that **outputs improve iteratively until quality thresholds are met**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Recursive prompting triggers when quality score <7.0
2. Self-referential improvement through meta-cognitive analysis
3. Maximum 5 improvement cycles to prevent infinite loops
4. Each cycle must show measurable improvement (>0.5 score)
5. Generated functions tested against hand-crafted baselines
6. Learning from successful patterns stored in LTM
7. Community voting validates generated function quality
8. Automatic documentation generation for new functions
9. Performance tracking: generation time, quality scores, adoption

## Story 4.4: Dynamic Architecture with SWARM Learning
As a **system learning from community usage**,  
I want **architecture evolution based on collective intelligence**,  
so that **the system improves through aggregated user patterns**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. SWARM memory aggregates successful architectural patterns
2. Pattern effectiveness requires >3 users with >9.0 score
3. Privacy engine ensures all patterns are anonymized
4. A/B testing compares community vs local patterns
5. Architecture updates require 95% confidence threshold
6. Rollback capability for failed architecture changes
7. Community dashboards show collective improvements
8. Opt-in controls for architecture learning contribution
9. Monthly architecture evolution reports generated

## Story 4.5: Advanced Control Flow with Agent Orchestration
As a **developer creating multi-agent workflows**,  
I want **sophisticated orchestration patterns**,  
so that **complex tasks leverage multiple specialists optimally**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Sequential chaining with context handoff between agents
2. Parallel execution with result synthesis (Map-Reduce)
3. Conditional routing based on intermediate results
4. Exception handling delegates to Prompt Enhancer
5. State management across multi-agent workflows
6. Progress tracking for long-running workflows
7. Resource allocation prevents agent overload
8. Debugging shows full execution trace with timings
9. Workflow templates for common patterns

## Story 4.6: Community Marketplace with Quality Assurance
As a **member of the AI development community**,  
I want **curated cognitive functions with proven effectiveness**,  
so that **I can trust and adopt community contributions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Function submission requires test suite with >90% coverage
2. Automated quality validation before marketplace listing
3. Community ratings weighted by user expertise level
4. Function analytics: usage, success rate, performance
5. Malicious code detection prevents security threats
6. Version management with semantic versioning
7. One-click installation with dependency resolution
8. Revenue sharing for premium function creators
9. Monthly quality reports for all listed functions
