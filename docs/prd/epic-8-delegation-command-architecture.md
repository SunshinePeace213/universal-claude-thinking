# Epic 8: Delegation & Command Architecture

**Epic Goal**: Create the intelligent 3-stage delegation system for automatic task routing and implement the 5-category command structure for operational management. This epic enables seamless user experience through intelligent request handling and comprehensive system control without manual intervention.

**Business Value**:
- **95% Task Routing Accuracy**: Eliminates user friction from manual agent selection
- **Sub-100ms Routing Decisions**: Instant, transparent task delegation
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users focus on tasks, not tool selection
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities

**Technical Scope**:
- 3-stage delegation: keyword matching → semantic similarity → PE fallback
- Agent capability embeddings with confidence scoring
- 5-category command architecture (/monitor, /setup, /debug, /report, /maintain)
- Stateless command implementation for reliability
- Performance tracking and optimization framework

## Story 8.1: Keyword-Based Fast Delegation
As a **delegation system handling clear requests**,  
I want **instant routing based on keyword patterns**,  
so that **obvious tasks are delegated without computational overhead**.

**Detailed Description**: Many user requests contain clear indicators of intent (e.g., "search for", "analyze", "write"). The keyword matching stage provides near-instant delegation for these cases, checking against predefined patterns for each agent. This handles 60-70% of requests with <10ms latency.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Define comprehensive keyword patterns for each agent type
2. Implement pattern matching with <10ms latency
3. Support multi-keyword combinations and synonyms
4. Achieve 90% confidence for matched patterns
5. Log matches for pattern optimization
6. Support dynamic pattern updates without restart
7. Handle pattern conflicts with priority rules

## Story 8.2: Semantic Similarity Delegation
As a **delegation system handling complex requests**,  
I want **intelligent routing using semantic understanding**,  
so that **nuanced requests reach appropriate specialists**.

**Detailed Description**: When keyword matching fails or has low confidence, semantic delegation encodes the request and compares it against pre-computed agent capability embeddings. This handles variations, implicit intent, and complex multi-faceted requests that don't match simple patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pre-compute agent capability embeddings on initialization
2. Encode user requests with <50ms latency
3. Calculate cosine similarity against all agents simultaneously
4. Apply 0.7 confidence threshold for routing decisions
5. Support capability embedding updates for agent evolution
6. Provide similarity scores for all agents (for debugging)
7. Implement fallback when confidence is below threshold

## Story 8.3: Prompt Enhancer Fallback
As a **system handling ambiguous inputs**,  
I want **intelligent clarification when routing is uncertain**,  
so that **users are guided to express their needs clearly**.

**Detailed Description**: When both keyword and semantic matching fail to provide confident routing, the system delegates to the Prompt Enhancer (PE) agent. PE analyzes the ambiguous input and provides 3-5 clarification options, helping users refine their requests for successful delegation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Route to PE when delegation confidence <0.7
2. Generate 3-5 specific clarification options
3. Provide examples for each clarification option
4. Track clarification success rates for improvement
5. Support multi-turn clarification if needed
6. Learn from clarification patterns for future routing
7. Maintain conversation context through clarification

## Story 8.4: Command Architecture Implementation
As a **system operator needing operational control**,  
I want **comprehensive commands for system management**,  
so that **I can monitor, debug, and maintain the system effectively**.

**Detailed Description**: The 5-category command architecture provides stateless operational capabilities that complement the stateful agent system. Commands are organized into logical categories (/monitor, /setup, /debug, /report, /maintain) for intuitive discovery and use.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement /monitor commands for real-time system health
2. Create /setup commands for installation and configuration
3. Develop /debug commands for troubleshooting and tracing
4. Build /report commands for analytics and insights
5. Design /maintain commands for cleanup and optimization
6. Support command discovery with help and autocomplete
7. Ensure all commands are stateless and idempotent

## Story 8.5: Delegation Performance Monitoring
As a **system focused on continuous improvement**,  
I want **comprehensive tracking of delegation decisions**,  
so that **routing accuracy improves over time**.

**Detailed Description**: Every delegation decision provides learning opportunities. This monitoring system tracks routing decisions, confidence scores, user satisfaction, and task outcomes to identify patterns and optimization opportunities, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Log all delegation decisions with confidence scores
2. Track delegation accuracy through task completion
3. Monitor latency for each delegation stage
4. Identify common routing failures and patterns
5. Generate delegation analytics and reports
6. Support A/B testing of routing strategies
7. Provide real-time delegation dashboard

## Story 8.6: Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
As a **system handling complex multi-faceted tasks**,  
I want **coordinated delegation to multiple specialists**,  
so that **complex requests are handled comprehensively**.

**Detailed Description**: Some requests require multiple agents working together (e.g., "research and analyze this topic, then write a report"). This story implements coordination patterns including sequential handoffs, parallel execution, and result synthesis for complex multi-agent workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Detect multi-agent requirements from request analysis
2. Support sequential agent chaining with context passing
3. Enable parallel agent execution for independent subtasks
4. Implement Map-Reduce pattern for research aggregation
5. Coordinate result synthesis across multiple agents
6. Maintain execution context throughout workflow
7. Provide progress tracking for long-running workflows
