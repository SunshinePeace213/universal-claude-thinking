# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
The Universal Claude Thinking v2 system will utilize a monorepo structure to maintain all cognitive architecture components, sub-agent specifications, memory systems, and community function libraries in a single, coordinated repository. This enables simplified dependency management, atomic commits across cognitive layers, and unified versioning for the complex multi-agent system.

## Service Architecture
**Modular Cognitive Architecture within Claude Code CLI**: The system implements a sophisticated modular architecture built on Claude Code's native sub-agent infrastructure. The 7-layer Context Engineering system operates as coordinated modules with the Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture providing specialized cognitive processing through individual context windows. This hybrid approach combines the simplicity of native infrastructure with the sophistication of advanced cognitive architectures.

## Testing Requirements
**Comprehensive Cognitive Testing Pyramid**: The system requires full testing coverage including unit tests for individual cognitive tools, integration tests for sub-agent coordination, end-to-end tests for complete cognitive workflows, and specialized cognitive capability validation tests. Testing must validate cognitive reasoning quality, parallel processing coordination, memory system integrity, and community function reliability.
