## Enhanced Orchestration Architecture

### Simplified Management Through Native Infrastructure

**Before**: Complex orchestration logic with custom coordination systems
**After**: Native `/agents` command management with preserved cognitive sophistication

```
User Input → Prompt Enhancement → Sub-Agent Delegation → Parallel Processing → Result Orchestration
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                     ↓                  ↓
Atomic Analysis → Quality Validation → Specialist Selection → Individual Context → Synthesis
```

1. **Prompt Enhancement Phase**: Prompt-Enhancer sub-agent validates and improves input
2. **Task Classification**: A/B/C/D/E classification determines sub-agent selection
3. **Parallel Delegation**: Multiple specialist sub-agents process simultaneously
4. **Context Isolation**: Each sub-agent maintains individual context window
5. **Result Integration**: Orchestrator synthesizes parallel outputs
6. **Memory Integration**: SWARM memory spans across sub-agents

### True Parallel Processing Capabilities
