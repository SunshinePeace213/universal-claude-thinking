# Memory System Integration with Sub-Agent Context Windows

## Overview: Cross-Context Memory Architecture

The Enhanced Sub-Agent Architecture integrates sophisticated memory systems with individual context windows, enabling persistent intelligence across isolated sub-agent contexts while maintaining specialized processing capabilities and cross-session continuity.

## Core Memory Integration Principles

### Distributed Memory Architecture
**Memory operates across multiple layers:**
- **Individual Context Memory**: Specialist-specific memory within each sub-agent context
- **Cross-Sub-Agent Memory**: Shared memory systems spanning all specialist contexts
- **Persistent Session Memory**: Long-term memory maintained across sessions and interactions
- **Community Memory**: Collective intelligence shared across users and implementations

### Memory Coordination Benefits
- **Context Specialization**: Each sub-agent maintains relevant memory for their expertise
- **Cross-Context Learning**: Insights from one specialist benefit other specialists
- **Enhanced Continuity**: Better cross-session memory through specialized contexts
- **Collective Intelligence**: Community learning enhances individual sub-agent performance

    """
    if memory_type == "research_findings":
        # Share research results with reasoner for analysis
        shared_data = source_specialist.extract_research_findings()
        target_specialist.integrate_research_context(shared_data)
    
    elif memory_type == "analytical_insights":
        # Share reasoning results with writer for documentation

    """
    Dynamically adjust memory allocation based on task needs
    """
    if task_complexity == "high":
        # Allocate more memory for specialist expertise and coordination
        return {
            "specialist_expertise": "enhanced",
            "cross_context_coordination": "increased",
